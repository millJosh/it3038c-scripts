# Welcome to My App

My app is so great, sometimes it works! Just download the script, add some execute permissions, and run it. The results should show you a list of all the cat pictures on your machine.

## Code Highlighting Example

Here's a JavaScript code block to highlight what's happening in my code:

```javascript
// This is a JavaScript code block
function getCatPictures() {
  // Your code here
}
