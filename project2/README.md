# Example of expected output: 
Total Space: 4 GB
Free Space: 1 GB
Used Space: 2 GB

It shows how much sapce someone has used, has aviabale and the total amount of their space

## How it functions: 
Through the function "import datetime" we can use the commands it provides us to show our date and time in a simple manner.
1. We need to first name the date and time, I used time_now.
2. Then we make it a string in addition with the commands we gain with the import, I named it timedate_format and you can see the code as a guide to see what I put for the rest.
3. The last thing to do is print it; put what you want in " " and put what you named the string at the end for me it is timedate_format

## Instructions: 
You would first download the project file "time_and_date_currently.py", and go to a machine (perferably a linux machine) that has python install and move the file there so you can use the commands to run this project. 
And to get the result as shown, in the command prompt go to the directory with the file in it and you would type python than the files name in the command prompt. 
So it would look something like this: 

python time_and_date_currently.py
