# Using Numpy in Python!
Here is how you can run a python script that I created

You need to first go to a machine that has python installed preferable a centos machine, which is what I ran my code on

You should have python since you are apart of this class, and to check your python version you can do: 

#### python --version

Then you want to do: 

#### pip install numpy

If you don't happen to have pip, which you should have, you can get it by:

For verions that start with a 2 and on use:

#### python get-pip.py

For versions 3.4 and later on use:

#### python -m ensurepip --default-pip

and then run the pip install numpy code above again

Now Numpy should be up and running now and you should be able to run my script 

### How to run my code

When you take a look at the file their will be comments that tell you what each section does and how it works so 
I would recommend you read those comments and try things for yourself at the bottom of the script or if you just want to see the output go to the command prompt 
and cd to the directory you downloaded the file too and type in:

#### python Lab7.py

Overall I hope you learn some cool things and have fun!
