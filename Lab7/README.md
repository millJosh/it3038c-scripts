# Using Numpy in Python!
Here is how you can run a python script that I created

You need to first go to a machine that has python instead perferable a centos machine, which is what I ran my code on

To check your python version you can do: python --version

Then you want to do: pip install numpy

If you don't have pip which you should you can do:

#### python get-pip.py

for verions that start with a 2 and on or use: 

#### python -m ensurepip --default-pip

for versions 3.4 and later

Numpy should be up and running and you should be able to run my script, make sure everytime to try to use Numpy always do: 

#### import numpy as np 

at the top of your code it makes it a lot easier
