# Using Numpy in Python!
Here is how you can run a python script that I created

You need to first go to a machine that has python instead preferable a centos machine, which is what I ran my code on

You should have python since you are apart of this class, and to check your python version you can do: 

#### python --version

Then you want to do: 

#### pip install numpy

If you don't happen to have pip, which you should have, you can get it by:

#### python get-pip.py

for verions that start with a 2 and on or use: 

#### python -m ensurepip --default-pip

for versions 3.4 and later

and then run the install numpy code above again

Now Numpy should be up and running now and you should be able to run my script 

### How to run my code

When you take a look at the file their will be comments that tell you what each section does and how it works so 
I would recommend you read those comments and try things for yourself at the bottom of the script or if you want see the output go to the directory you download it too and run:

#### python Lab7.py

Overall I hope you learn some cool things and have fun!
